Project overview-
Simple shopping cart web application that primarly uses JavaScript with VueJs as the library framework on the front end. Firebase Firestore database was implemented for a continously updated database of shopping cart items. 

Programming Languages- 

(Front End)

HTML- (Hypertext Markup Language)- The website utilized html to stucture the webpages and their content.

SCSS- (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet)- SCSS is a subset of CSS and was used to style the format of the HTML elements we created.

JavaScript- Utilized the VueJs open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework. JavaScript gave the website its functionality, more specifically the hyperlink redirection.

(Back End)

TypeScript- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript and was used in this project to connect the firebase firestore database to the front end.

Firebase Infrastructure- 
Cloud Firestore is a scalable NoSQL cloud database that keeps application data in sync accross the client and serverside regardless of network connectivity or latency. Firestore's NoSQL model allows us to store data as documents containing fields mapped to certain values. The documents are then stored in collections, which allows us to organize our data and build queries. In this project we utilized shallow queries to retrieve and filter data and added realtime listeners to keep the data in our web application updated, without having to constantly retrieve our entire database.   

Security- Public server
